# Motor Profile System - Corrected Definitions

## Overview

Our motor profile system classifies hitters based on **anthropometry (body type)** and **kinetic power sources**, adapted from BioSwing Dynamics research.

## The 4 Motor Profiles

### 1. **SPINNER**
**Body Type:** Shorter, stockier build; compact frame; lower center of gravity  
**Primary Power Source:** Rotation (Torque) - generates power through hip and torso rotation  
**Lever Characteristics:** Shorter levers (arms/legs relative to torso)  
**Swing Characteristics:**
- Excellent rotational mechanics
- High pelvis and torso velocity
- Compact, quick swing
- Strong ground connection
- Power from lower half
- Quick to ball

**Famous Examples:** Jose Altuve, Dustin Pedroia, David Eckstein  
**Typical Metrics:**
- Ground Score: 70-85
- Engine Score: 75-90 (HIGH - key differentiator)
- Weapon Score: <65

**Advantages:**
- Quick bat through zone
- Good vs inside pitches
- Strong timing and rhythm
- Lower half dominates

**Challenges:**
- May "spin off" ball
- Vulnerable to outer half
- Hands can disconnect from rotation
- Energy loss at contact

**Training Focus:** Connect hands to body rotation; improve transfer efficiency

---

### 2. **SLINGSHOTTER**
**Body Type:** Longer levers; athletic build; good length  
**Primary Power Source:** Lower body drive (Glide) + moderate rotation  
**Lever Characteristics:** Longer arms/legs; good extension capability  
**Swing Characteristics:**
- Powerful lower body engagement
- Good hip-shoulder separation potential
- Uses length to create leverage
- Strong when connected
- Can generate elite exit velocities

**Famous Examples:** Early Giancarlo Stanton, Adam Dunn, Kyle Schwarber  
**Typical Metrics:**
- Ground Score: 70-85 (HIGH)
- Engine Score: 60-75 (MODERATE)
- Weapon Score: <65

**Advantages:**
- Raw power generation
- Strong lower half
- High peak exit velocities when connected
- Good separation potential

**Challenges:**
- Inconsistent bat path
- Energy leaks in transfer
- Long swing (vulnerable to velocity)
- Struggles with breaking balls
- Length can work against control

**Training Focus:** Improve bat control and hand path; shorten swing; consistent transfer

---

### 3. **WHIPPER**
**Body Type:** Lean, quick hands; often smaller frame OR long levers used incorrectly  
**Primary Power Source:** Arms/hands (upper body dominant)  
**Lever Characteristics:** Variable; defined by power source, not length  
**Swing Characteristics:**
- Arm-dominant mechanics
- Quick bat speed through zone
- Minimal lower body engagement
- Short, direct swing
- Good bat-to-ball skills

**Famous Examples:** Ichiro Suzuki, Tony Gwynn (early career), contact-first hitters  
**Typical Metrics:**
- Ground Score: <65 (LOW - key identifier)
- Engine Score: 55-75
- Weapon Score: 70-85 (HIGH)

**Advantages:**
- Quick hands
- Good contact ability
- Short swing
- Can handle velocity
- Bat control

**Challenges:**
- Limited power
- Poor lower body use
- Low exit velocities
- Struggles vs off-speed
- Arm-dominant = low ceiling

**Training Focus:** Develop lower body connection; engage hips; build ground force production

---

### 4. **TITAN**
**Body Type:** Massive, older, physically mature; elite across all metrics  
**Primary Power Source:** Multi-source (Glide + Spin + Launch) - "Trifecta"  
**Lever Characteristics:** Variable; profile defined by elite performance, not body type  
**Swing Characteristics:**
- Elite mechanics across all components
- High ground force production
- Excellent energy transfer
- Consistent barrel control
- High exit velocities
- Mature, professional-level mechanics

**Famous Examples:** Mike Trout, Aaron Judge, Mookie Betts (peak), Kyle Tucker (MLB-level)  
**Typical Metrics:**
- Ground Score: 80-100
- Engine Score: 80-100
- Weapon Score: 80-100

**Advantages:**
- Elite power from ground up
- Excellent kinetic chain
- Consistent barrel control
- Can handle all pitch types
- Well-rounded skillset

**Challenges:**
- High bar to maintain
- Minor flaws = major impact
- Requires consistent training
- Often slower movers (mass/size)

**Training Focus:** Maintain elite status; fine-tune timing; optimize efficiency

## Classification Logic

### Primary Differentiators:

**SPINNER:**
- **Key:** HIGH Engine Score (75+) + HIGH Ground Score (70+) + LOW Weapon (<65)
- **Body:** Shorter, stockier
- **Power:** Rotation-dominant

**SLINGSHOTTER:**
- **Key:** HIGH Ground Score (70+) + MODERATE Engine (60-75) + LOW Weapon (<65)
- **Body:** Longer levers
- **Power:** Lower body drive with length

**WHIPPER:**
- **Key:** LOW Ground Score (<65) + HIGH Weapon (70+)
- **Body:** Variable (lean OR long levers used incorrectly)
- **Power:** Arm/hand-dominant

**TITAN:**
- **Key:** ALL scores 80+ (elite across board)
- **Body:** Mature, physically developed (often slower mover due to mass)
- **Power:** Multi-source (Trifecta)

---

## Anthropometry Influence

### Based on BioSwing Dynamics Research:

**Shorter Levers (Short Arms/Legs):**
- Natural SPINNERS
- Compact rotation
- Quick to ball
- Power from hips/torso

**Medium Levers (Balanced Proportions):**
- Can be SPINNER or SLINGSHOTTER depending on training
- Balanced mechanics
- Versatile

**Longer Levers (Long Arms/Legs):**
- Natural SLINGSHOTTERS (when trained correctly)
- Natural WHIPPERS (when using arms only)
- Length = leverage potential OR control problem
- Need strong lower body to harness length

**Mature/Massive Build:**
- Potential TITANS
- Physical maturity = elite metrics
- Often slower movers but elite power
- Requires years of training

---

## Key Insight: Lever Length ≠ Profile

**The motor profile is determined by HOW you use your body, not just body type:**

- **Long levers + good lower body** = SLINGSHOTTER
- **Long levers + arms only** = WHIPPER
- **Short levers + rotation** = SPINNER
- **Any build + elite training** = TITAN

## Updated Profile Examples

### Connor Gray (16, 6'0", 160 lbs, 76" wingspan)
- **Current:** Pelvis 60°, Torso 25°, Bat Speed 59.4 mph
- **Profile:** SPINNER (good rotation, compact build, 99% exospeed capacity)
- **Training:** Refine sequencing, maintain rotation

### Eric Williams (33, 5'8", 190 lbs)
- **Current:** Pelvis 2.87°, Torso 1.95°, Bat Speed 82 mph (arms only)
- **Profile:** WHIPPER (low rotation, arm-dominant, minimal body)
- **Training:** Build lower body connection (Drills #1, #4, #7)

### Kyle Tucker (28, 6'4", 212 lbs, 78" wingspan)
- **Current:** Pelvis 55°, Torso 35°, Bat Speed 75 mph, MLB-level
- **Profile:** TITAN (elite rotation + elite transfer + massive frame + pro training)
- **Training:** Maintain elite status

## Application to Kyle Tucker & Connor Gray

### Kyle Tucker Reclassification:
- **Previous (Incorrect):** SYNCER
- **Correct:** TITAN
- **Reason:** Elite across all metrics (100/100 KRS); MLB-level performance; 6'4" 212 lbs mature build; multi-source power; elite rotation + transfer

### Connor Gray:
- **Confirmed:** SPINNER
- **Reason:** 6'0" compact build; elite rotation (60° pelvis); high engine use; 99% exospeed capacity; power from rotation
