## 🎯 REVISED DAY 2 PLAN

Given that your instructions provide **extremely detailed specifications** for Tasks 2-4, I have two options:

### OPTION A: Create Screens Per Your Exact Specifications (Recommended)
- Follow your detailed instructions verbatim
- Copy/adapt the exact layouts, API specs, and requirements you provided
- This will produce comprehensive, implementation-ready documentation
- **Pros**: Matches your expectations perfectly, reduces chance of errors
- **Cons**: More time-consuming (~6 hours for remaining 3 tasks)

### OPTION B: Create Condensed Versions
- Distill your requirements into shorter specifications
- Focus on critical elements only
- **Pros**: Faster completion (~3 hours)
- **Cons**: Less detailed, may require follow-up corrections

**Recommendation**: **OPTION A** - Follow your specifications exactly as provided.

## 🚀 NEXT STEPS (Immediate)

I will now proceed with **TASK 2** using your detailed specifications:

1. Create `SCREEN_04_MOVEMENT_ASSESSMENT.md` with:

   - 4 states per movement (Instruction/Recording/Analyzing/Result)
   - Motor Profile determination algorithm

   - Complete API specs
   - ~800-1000 lines

2. Then proceed to TASK 3 (Motor Profile Result screen)
