This causes you to pull the bat across instead of extending through, forcing your shoulders to over-rotate (8.68x, should be 0.7-1.5x).\n\nThe result? A drag pattern with zero late whip, losing 5-9 mph and causing you to roll over breaking balls.\n\n**The Fix:** Teach your front leg to LOCK and create vertical bounce. We'll use single-leg jumps to train your lead knee extension, Force Pedals to create vertical ground force, and rope swings to restore your bat whip.\n\n**Expected Results (6 weeks):**\n• Exit Velo: 82 → 89 mph (+7 mph)\n• Launch Angle: 2° → 15° (ground balls → line drives)\n• Breaking Ball AVG: .180 → .280\n• Hip Contribution: 2.1 → 8-10+ angular momentum\n• Line Drive Rate: 25% → 55%\n\nYou have all the ingredients. Now we just need to fix the knee leak so your hips can do their job.",
